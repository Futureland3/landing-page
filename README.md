After a bit of a break, which may have been a few weeks, I am now getting started on this project, now that I have no exam to study for for 2 weeks. 
I don't even remember how to do the git commit, add and all that stuff anymore. Procrastination also got the best of me. Regarding the fact that I gotta work on this course, study for my classes, work on Saturdays, and I'd still like to improve my French, I made a priority list, and I'll work on these things one by one each day. Once I get tired of this project, I'll hop on to my college classes. And once I'm tired of those too, I get to improve my French and play some games, two things I can do all day, so I gotta keep them for last. 
When will I have free time when I just gotta focus on one thing and then have the day free?
